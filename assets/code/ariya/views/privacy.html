            <p>
                This privacy policy covers Àríyá's treatment of personally identifiable information collected by Àríyá through a website owned and operated by Àríyá.

            <h2>Price Guarantee & Currency Exchange Rates</h2>
            <p>We offer three ways to make payment. There is an option to Pay in Cash by contacting the Venue Owner, in which case, Àríyá cannot guarantee that your reservation will be kept for you, or that we will inform you about cancellations before you arrive, and we are not responsible for any disappointments that may be faced by choosing this payment method or a hotel that accepts only it. With some Event centres, you are only able to make payment for your reservation using this medium.</p>
            <p>We present another option to pay into our locally operated Bank Account; you can pay money in three different ways: if you are not in Nigeria, an international bank transfer can be done, if you are situated anywhere within Nigeria, a local online bank transfer can be done or you may pay money directly into our bank account at any recognised branch of the bank we operate with.</p>
            <p>The third payment option we offer is through the use of ATM Cards. You can pay with your ATM card through a third party link we provide on the website. Àríyá does not process any other type of card payments, including credit card payments. Any amount charged to you will be in Nigerian Naira. Tax rates and foreign exchange rates could change in the time between booking and stay.</p>
